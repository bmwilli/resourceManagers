## MAJOR ISSUES:
* Large timeout for Streams seems to cause really slow reaction to things like:
	* notify of revoke
	* <wait>
	* Requests release
	* <wait>
	* Streamtool exits that not enough resources could be allocated
	
* Mitigation: Add some delay between when task goes RUNNING and notifying streams
* Why? Mesos Command Executor returns running when shell sharts running, but if Streams is going to fail
* it will happen rather quickly in the case of pre-installed software, or it will take a long time if deploying
* if it happens quicly we can retry and thus avoid telling Streams we have allocated the resource


## mkdomain command
streamtool mkdomain --property domain.externalResourceManager=mesos

## start mesos manager 
./streams-on-mesos start --master zk://172.31.29.41:2181/mesos

## Get status of Mesos Resource Manager
./streams-on-mesos status -d StreamsDomain

## Resource Specification Commands
### Show resource specifications
streamtool lsresources -l
### Remove resource specification
streamtool rmresourcespec 2
### Add resource specification
streamtool addresourcespec --numresources 1
streamtool addresourcespec --numresources 1[exclusive]
streamtool addresourcespec --numresources 1,ingest
streamtool addresourcespec --numresources 1,ingest[exclusive]

## Concern ISSUE!!
* Using mesos CommandExecutor
  - It may report running while command is still running streamsresourcesetup.sh and controller is not yet started
  - Only way to get around this may be to implement our own executor that does not report running until it is
  - Work around: Like YARN resource manager set domain.serviceStartTimeout=300

## To Do (Working notes to get version 0.1.0 ready)
* Change to using controller.startTimeout to wait
	* Retry failure situation (mv /opt/ibm to /opt/ibmxxx on slaves)
		* Is it any faster to fail
	* Retry deploy situation...does it wait long enough for it to come up?
	
* Check application.log in sandbox for java not found error

* Suspend offers when no resources waiting

* Handle type as an argument even down to resource display name naming
	
* Handle error condition when framework killed but zookeeper thinks domain is running
  * streamtool stopdomain --force will try and release resource...handle gracefully
* Where is proper place to create descriptor?
  - Move it to the State
* Revisit arguments and properties
* Initial version of --deploy (done)
  * Will come back to this after getting stuff to work
* Validate Stop
  * Prevent shutdown (unless --force) if we have resources being used

## Development issues:
* Started using the YARN resource manager as a model where only handled specified domain and zookeeper
* Moving toward Symphony approach to support multiple
* Code in transition (example allocateResources, get domainID from clientInfo or argument?)
	* For now do both and look for inconsistencies
	* Future move to just cilentID and remove domainId as a required argument

## Development Questions:
* sampleRM had a lot of logic about re-using resources that are already beeing used but were not excluded by the new allocateResources request.  Should we implement that?  When would you do that?  Would we do that in the case that we configured the resource manager to take entire offers?
	* ANSWER Not required since we use containers.  Only required when giving out whole machines
	* Could come into play if we truly accepted entire offer
## Future
* Supress offers from mesos until there is a resource request
* Handle multiple multiple clients (e.g. multiple domains)
* Ability to run Mesos Resource Manager as root or a user
  * root would allow easier authentication with pam (security.runAsRoot)
  * user would limit to single user if pam authentication used
* Instructions and test for PKI authentication
* Resource packing when offers have more resources that needed (see Building applications on mesos book)
* If cpu and mem set to -1, then use entire offer for a resource...done..not sure we really want to do this, so DONT
* Marathon submission of framework
  * run streams-on-mesos from marathon
* Streams Resource Manager custom commands to get internal state of allResources list, etc.
* Web interface to get internal state
* Persistent State manager - see Symphony Resource Manager
	* ValidateState
* High Availability
	* Mesos - Handle Master failover, Reconcile Tasks, Handle Scheduler failover
	* Streams - Do the same
* Convert exceptions to ResourceManagerMessageException, did not see the API for that
* Enhance logging (see Symphony resource manager)




## Testing on Linux Workstation
I have not tested these instructions yet

1. Build and Install Mesos (I used 1.0.1)

	See Mesos instructions

	export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib"

2. Run standalone Mesos and Slave (no zookeeper)

	mesos-master --ip=127.0.0.1 --work_dir=/var/lib/mesos
	mesos-agent --master=127.0.0.1:5050 --work_dir=/var/lib/mesos


3. Run zookeeper (from docker) (for Streams).

	docker run -d \
	-p 2181:2181 \
	-p 2888:2888 \
	-p 3888:3888 \
	jplock/zookeeper

	export STERAMS_ZKCONNECT=localhost:2181

4. Run streams-on-mesos using standalone master uri

	cd scripts
	./streams-on-mesos start --master localhost:5050 --deploy

	
	
## Testing on Workstation with Docker for development


0. Get IP Address of Docker Server

	export HOST_IP=127.0.0.1

1. Run zookeeper.

	docker run -d \
	> -p 2181:2181 \
	> -p 2888:2888 \
	> -p 3888:3888 \
	> garland/zookeeper

	export STERAMS_ZKCONNECT=localhost:2181

2. Ensure Streams variables set

	source <streams install location>/4.2.0.0/bin/streamsprofile.sh

3. Start Mesos Master

	docker run --net="host" \
	-p 5050:5050 \
	-e "MESOS_HOSTNAME=${HOST_IP}" \
	-e "MESOS_IP=${HOST_IP}" \
	-e "MESOS_ZK=zk://${HOST_IP}:2181/mesos" \
	-e "MESOS_PORT=5050" \
	-e "MESOS_LOG_DIR=/var/log/mesos" \
	-e "MESOS_QUORUM=1" \
	-e "MESOS_REGISTRY=in_memory" \
	-e "MESOS_WORK_DIR=/var/lib/mesos" \
	-d \
	garland/mesosphere-docker-mesos-master
